Debug and fix the admin dashboard issues in /redi-web related to weekly prompt management. 

## Current Issues:
1. Creating a new weekly prompt is not working
3. Testing prompt creation section of dashboards is not working
4. Active and scheduled prompts are not displaying properly
5. Cannot schedule a prompt - getting an error that "release day isn't a Monday" even though it's set as Monday
6. Need ability to set prompts to be released and generate matches on any day (not just Mondays)

## Investigation Steps:

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Examine the admin dashboard code in /redi-web for weekly prompt creation and display
2. Review all backend endpoints related to prompts (creation, scheduling, retrieval)
3. Investigate cloud functions that handle:
   - Prompt scheduling and release logic
   - Matching algorithm triggers
   - Day-of-week validation
4. Identify where the Monday restriction is enforced (frontend validation, backend validation, or cloud function logic)
5. Check how active/scheduled prompts are fetched and why they're not displaying

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification
- Map out the complete flow from admin dashboard → backend endpoints → cloud functions
- Identify all points where day validation occurs
- Find discrepancies between what the UI sends vs what the backend expects
- Check for timezone issues that might affect day-of-week calculations

### Phase 3: Fix Planning
Before making any changes, present me with:
1. A summary of all issues found
2. Proposed fixes for each issue
3. Whether endpoints need modification to allow any-day prompt creation for testing
4. Impact assessment of changes (what might break, what needs updating)
5. Wait for my approval before proceeding

### Phase 4: Implementation
After I approve the plan:
1. Fix the prompt creation functionality
2. Fix the active/scheduled prompts display
3. Remove or make configurable the Monday-only restriction
4. Enable prompt release and match generation for any day
5. Ensure all changes maintain data consistency

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates
Update the following files to reflect any changes made to prompt and matching workflows:
- /Users/jujucrane/dev/redi/TESTING_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS.md
- /Users/jujucrane/dev/redi/backend/MATCHING_ALGORITHM_GUIDE.md
- /Users/jujucrane/dev/redi/backend/MATCHING_WORKFLOW.md

Specifically document:
- How the updated prompt scheduling works
- Any changes to day-of-week logic
- New testing capabilities (if any-day scheduling is enabled)
- Updated matching trigger logic

## Important Notes:
- Preserve existing functionality wherever possible
- If testing-specific changes are needed, make them configurable (e.g., via environment variables)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing scheduled prompts
- Test the complete flow after fixes

Start with Phase 1 analysis and show me what you find before proceeding to fixes.
